Schampignon is an experimental interpreter, related to the
Virtua programming language: http://manuel.github.com/virtua

There are multiple branches:

* The master branch is an interpreter for a Kernel-like language, and
  it where current work happens.

* The dybvig branch is the original starting point, a port of a Scheme
  interpreter by Kent Dybvig.

* The fexpr branch is a reworking of the dybvig branch to support
  fexprs, but it's not really functional in any interesting sense.
